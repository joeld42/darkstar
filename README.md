LD Basecode 2016-2019
-----------------

New attempt at a reasonable basecode, on top of Oryol engine. 

Why is it called DARKSTAR? Because "Darkstar crashes...".

DARKSTAR is a codename for the project, and will be replaced by the template script. Originally
I just called it TEMPLATE but that had some name collisions so this time I'm going with something
more unique and script-searchable.

All WIP, not really working yet...

`scripts/mk_project` -- still needs to be updated after the namechange but will copy the project over to a
fresh copy to start a new LDJAM.
